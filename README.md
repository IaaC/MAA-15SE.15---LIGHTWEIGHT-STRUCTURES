ADAPTIVE NESTING

How do we inhabit in the desert if there is just sand? And the north pole where the only material is ice? How would we inhabit the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars? And how will we build the habitat of the future and which will it be the material available?

The way humans and animals build their dwellings is highly conditioned by the limited available resources in a certain environment: a key point of the success of a certain species is based on adaptability, considered as the capability to cover the basic necessities for survival, taking the maximum advantages of what is there.

Based on the idea of adaptation to a limited resource environment this course is oriented to explore the possibilities of imagining and building the dwelling of a hypothetical post consumistic future, taking advantages of whatever material will be left available. Working on the structural concept of "components" we are going to explore the structural possibilities hidden within each basic element in order to build a series of 1:1 structures, designed after manual testings and digital simulations.

Through the understanding of the objects capacities, characteristics and limitations, we will be able to link the physical model properties to a digital environment. This allows us to increase the scale in the computation exploration, run simulations, dictate geometries, connectivities and assembly manufacturing protocols to create complex component based systems.

Working with developing the “rules of the game”, we will start by understanding the parametric properties of the primitive component and later with the help of algorithmic tools such as grasshopper, we can parametrically control our designs. By introducing recursivity procedures with Anemone we can design complexity through multiple loops to regenerate and create an adaptive design growth system. Consequently, using live physics simulations with kangaroo we will be able to test the structure’s system behavior resulting in a variety of digitally designed iterations. Such algorithms are means to enhance the design development process.
